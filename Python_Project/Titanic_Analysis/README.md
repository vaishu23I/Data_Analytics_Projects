# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis using Python

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore which factors most influenced passenger survival, using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handle missing values and clean the dataset
- Visualize survival distribution by gender, age, class, and more
- Build basic insights from the data

## 📂 Files Included
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis
- `titanic.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `output_graphs/` – (Optional) Saved charts and plots
- `README.md` – Project explanation (this file)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers had better chances of survival.
- Family size and ticket fare had correlations with survival rate.

## 📌 Conclusion
The Titanic dataset provides a great introduction to data preprocessing, visualization, and extracting actionable insights using Python.
