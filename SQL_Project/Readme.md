# ðŸ›’ Flipkart Product Data Analysis using SQL

This project explores Flipkart product data using SQL queries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from an e-commerce product catalog â€” including pricing, stock levels, customer interest, and product categories.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Create a database and product table structure
- Insert realistic product data
- Run SQL queries to analyze:
  - Popular product categories
  - Stock vs sales performance
  - Seller listings and return policies
  - Discount trends and pricing analysis

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

- `flipkart.sql` â€“ SQL script that:
  - Creates the database and table (`product`)
  - Inserts sample product data
- `README.md` â€“ Project overview and explanation

---

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset Structure (in SQL)

The table `product` includes:

- `Product_Name` (text)
- `Price`, `Rating`, `Discount`
- `Number_of_Buyers`, `Total_Sold`, `Available_Stock`
- `Main_Category`, `Sub_Category`
- `Seller`, `Return_Policy`, `Product_URL`

---

## ðŸ§  Sample Query Ideas

- Top 5 categories with the highest sales
- Products with stock less than 100
- Average rating by category
- Sellers offering return policy = TRUE
- Products with more than 40% discount

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- MySQL / SQL Server / SQLite
- Any SQL IDE (e.g., DB Browser, MySQL Workbench)

---

## âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to simulate a real-world e-commerce database and gain actionable business insights.
